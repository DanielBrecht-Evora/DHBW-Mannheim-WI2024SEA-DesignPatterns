*Please install go, if you haven't done so: https://go.dev/doc/install*

The code example contains both interfaces needed for the iterator pattern. There are two implmented aggregates, Playlist and CD.

## How to run
1. Change into `iterator_michelle_jannis` with `cd iterator_michelle_jannis` if you haven't done so
2. Execute `go run .`. You should now see titles of songs
